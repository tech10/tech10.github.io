<p>
By using an account on the Variety Network TeamTalk server, you agree to follow all rules outlined below. Please note that both users and administrators must follow the same rules, though there are rules specific to administrators that will also be outlined.
</p>
<h2>User guidelines</h2>
<p>
All of these guidelines boil down to the following statement. Act with respect and maturity. However, there are other rules regarding accounts and other topics that don't necessarily fall under behavior, so please read them all.
</p>
<ul>
<li>First, and most important, you are responsible for anything that occurs under your account. Your account shouldn't be given to other users, as your account identifies you on the server. If your account has been found to be given to another user, it will be deleted and you will be notified of the infraction.</li>
<li>If you are in a meeting with the administrators and you deliberately leave the server, your account will be removed.</li>
<li>If a third party chooses to use your computer to speak on the TeamTalk server, they must do so under the account holders supervision.</li>
<li>If you have been banned from the server and feel the decision was unjust, you can talk to the administrators and try to appeal your ban. If the administrators decide to keep your ban, the decision will be permanent and will not be changed.</li>
<li>Please note that this server may contain situations of a mature nature. Therefore, you must be eighteen or older, and/or have the capability of dealing with adult situations in an adult manor. If this is determined not to be the case, your account will be removed from the server. Anyone under the age of eighteen wishing to join the server will be dealt with on a case by case basis.</li>
<li>As newcomers may connect to the root channel of the server first, try to keep it as welcoming as possible. Keep in mind that first impressions of the server will likely be received there before anywhere else.</li>
<li>Illegal transmitting, recording, or redistribution of any legal or illegal content will not be tolerated on this server. Not everything will be checked, but anything transmitted or distributed on the server is subject to being checked for copyright violation. Comply with copyright law.</li>
<li>Files can be uploaded and downloaded on the server. However, unless explicitly stated, such files are not to be redistributed to others who don't have access to the server. If files are redistributed without permission, you will first be spoken to regarding the matter. If you continue distributing files, or haven't removed them from requested media, your access to upload and download files from the server will be revoaked.</li>
<li>Act mature and with respect. To clarify this further, here are some of the things you should and shouldn't do.
<ul>
<li>You may express yourself as you wish, however, be mindful of others feelings and realize the server is not exclusive to any one individual.</li>
<li>Don't respond to emotion with more emotion. Usually, that will create more problems than it solves. For example, if someone is rude to you, don't be rude to them in return.</li>
<li>Don't be demeaning or disrespectful toward others. For example, calling someone a freak because of something they did is unacceptable. This goes for people who are and aren't on the server. If you dislike something someone did, express that dislike kindly rather than disrespectfully.</li>
<li>If you're having a bad day or are feeling strong emotions, it's all right to talk about them. However, don't take your feelings out on others, and don't talk about your bad day for minutes on end or each time you connect. This is a place for people to relax, not feel that they're uncomfortable or being pulled into your personal, emotional situations.</li>
<li>When talking about emotions or an emotional situation, try to avoid saying the first words that come to mind. Think about how you express yourself and weather or not you will offend or harm others, ensuring you do not lash out at groups or individuals. If people don't wish to talk about what you want to discuss, keep it to yourself or move to another channel with those that might wish to discuss it with you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may choose to use voice activation and constantly transmit if you wish. However, there are some exceptions to this guideline.
<ul>
<li>If you are using speakers, you must use a hot key to avoid loop back of audio and disturbing others. If you choose to use speakers and constantly transmit, note that only one person can do that at a time. If another is not constantly transmitting and they are using speakers, you must stop constantly transmitting if you wish to continue using speakers.</li>
<li>If your background noise is disturbing others and you are asked to use a hot key, do so. If you don't, you will be pulled aside by an administrator and spoken to.</li>
<li>If you're constantly transmitting, think of all your audio and/or video as being sent to a public setting. Use the same manners as you would in any public venue. If you're doing something inappropriate, you will be spoken to by the administrators and may, at their discression, be asked to use a hot key or no longer constantly transmit.</li>
<li>If you leave the room and you're not there attending your computer, try to remember to stop transmitting audio. Though bandwidth restrictions are looser, there isn't a need to waist it unnecessarily. This guideline also applies to the transmission of video.</li>
<li>If you receive a phone call, are dealing with personal information, or are having another conversation, either stop transmitting or mute your microphone if you're asked to do so. If you are transmitting nothing but silence for too long, you may be moved to the away channel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can create your own channels on the server. However, unless an administrator makes them persistent, they will disappear when all users have left the channel or channels. Please use reasonable settings when creating channels. The bit rate of codecs shouldn't exceed 192000, unless you have a good reason for higher quality audio settings. The name and topics of channels shouldn't be offensive or disrespectful. Passwords are the business of the creator, but it is preferred if they are respectful as well. This is subject to being enforced at any time, so be mindful.</li>
<li>Don't interrupt users with irrelevant conversation topics. For example, if people are talking about restaurants, don't jump in and tell everyone what your favorite peace of music is. It's okay to jump in and talk about your favorite restaurant, however. It is wise to wait, if possible, until all users are done speaking. If people are waiting to know the results of something previously discussed, jumping in with the results of such a conversation is also acceptable. If you must jump in at any other time, use proper manners when doing so.</li>
<li>It is wise if all users have a valid email address that is not temporary. This helps the administrators to inform the users about possible server changes that may effect them, or their usage on the server. If you choose not to give the administrators your email address, you cannot be contacted about such updates, and will not be informed about changes that may effect you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
One of the goals of this server is to keep it welcoming. If the above rules are followed, we should be successful. However, here's some general advice that you can choose to follow or discard that will make the server a better place.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don't like someone because of something they may have done, weather it be unintentional or not, it's a good idea to talk with the person and try to solve the problem you have. Avoiding them usually solves nothing, but determining a solution to your difficulties will go a long way toward feeling welcome and comfortable with that person. If you feel you can't solve your problems with another person, talk to one of the administrators. They are there to help you, and hopefully, to make the server a better place.</li>
<li>If you notice someone not following the rules, or behaving inappropriately, you're free to talk to that user about what the rules are. Simply remind them of the rules, how they're enforced, and what respectful and appropriate behavior is. Some people may need help in such areas, even administrators. Don't slander or be disrespectful yourself when assisting them, and if such topics of conversation start drama, end the conversation politely and refer the conversation to an administrator. If the administrator is the one starting drama, talk to whom ever you need to report what has happened, as they are to set good examples for the others on the server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Administrator guidelines</h2>
<p>
If you're an administrator on the server, you're there to ensure the guidelines are followed to the best of your ability. This means that you should follow them yourself. Set a good example for the community.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the user guidelines, here are the rules the administrators must follow.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not give your account to another user. If you are found to have done so, your administrator privileges will be permanently removed without notice.</li>
<li>All administrators must have a valid email address, so other administrators can contact them. If you do not have an email address, you cannot be kept up to date about server and administration changes.</li>
<li>If a user is added, banned, or deleted, please contact the main administrator at the very least. You should inform him of the action performed, your reasons for doing so, and the approximate time the action was taken. Clarifying your timezone and contacting the other administrators is advised.</li>
<li>Abide by the decisions made by other administrators. For example, if a user account has been removed or a user banned, talk to an administrator and determine why the decision has been made before adding them again.</li>
<li>Don't avoid people you don't like. You're there to administrate the server, not avoid problems. If you're unsure how to go about solving a problem, talk to another administrator.</li>
<li>Administrators can feel free to invite other users to the server, but please ensure that those users will follow the guidelines of the server to the best of your ability. If you don't think they can, don't invite them and don't add an account for them if they request one.</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to make a decision without the approval of the main administrator. That's what you're there for.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Other guidelines</h2>
<h3>Nickname and username guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>While not a requirement, it's generally a good idea, and easier on the administrators if you choose an account username that's close to the nickname you are using.</li>
<li>Nicknames should be distinctive and identify who you are. Using your first name in your nickname is a good idea, but if you go by techman123, that's fine, too. The only requirement is that your nickname be unique. For example, if you have two computers, you could connect using techman123 on one system, and techman123 secondary on the other.</li>
<li>Account and nick names should not be offensive. For example, don't include swear words in your nick name or account username.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Connections, disconnections, and idling clients on the server</h3>
<p>
If you want to be on the server, stay connected. If you don't, stay disconnected. Please don't intentionally connect and disconnect within short periods of time, as it may interrupt the flow of conversation. If you have to leave for a few minutes, it's fine to remain connected while you do whatever it is you have to do.
</p>
<p>
Please, don't idle for days at a time on the TeamTalk server where audio and video are being sent. It uses more bandwidth than you might realize, especially when many people are talking. Idling for a night or even a few days is fine, but please don't do it for weeks at a time. If you are found to be idling more than you are interacting with people on the server, the administrators will discuss it with you. If you continue to idle, your account may be removed. If you must idle for long periods of time, leave all channels or go to the away channel, which you may be moved to should you idle for longer than a few days.
</p>
<p>
Please note that muting the audio on your client doesn't prevent the data from being sent to you. You still receive it. If you think you're going to be gone for a few days or a week consistently, it's better to disconnect from the server.
</p>
<h3>Inactive users</h3>
<p>
To keep the user account list free of clutter, all users who haven't connected for six months will be removed on or around the date they were previously active. For example, if the last time you connected was on August 13, 2012, your account will be removed on or around February 13, 2013, give or take a few days. Connecting with any client that doesn't join a channel or interact with users doesn't count as being an active user. Interaction is considered connecting, speaking with people and becoming part of a conversation for more than a few minutes. If you connect, trade words for a few seconds and leave, you're not considered interacting.
</p>
<p>
You are also active if you've given a sufficient reason for not connecting, such as, I have school, a job, etc. However, a reason such as using the server as somewhere to go if you have nothing else to do is not a valid reason for remaining an active user. Also, when you connect, contribute to the conversations. If you don't communicate in any way when you connect, therefore appearing to be an idling client or a bot, it's likely your account will be removed.
</p>
<p>
If you have been inactive for a year, your account will be removed. At the moment, there are no exceptions to this rule.
</p>
<p>
If your account has been removed, you can request one again. Weather your account should or shouldn't be added will be discussed on a case by case basis.
</p>
<h3>Changes in this document</h3>
<p>
It is the responsibility of the users to regularly check the user agreement, as it may be changed or altered without notice to the users.
</p>
<h2>Obtaining an account</h2>
<p>
We are no longer adding new accounts to the server. This includes the removal of any inactive accounts, which will not be added again.
</p>
<h2>In closing...</h2>
<p>
Last, but not least, relax and enjoy yourself. That's why these servers exist. If you don't enjoy being here, please, contact an administrator and let them know why. We'd like to help you if we can.
